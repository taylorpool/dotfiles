1. Consent: Did I explicitly ask for permission to use the data? 
This is important in order to ensure that customers have a choice in what data to submit.
2. Clarity: Did I clearly explain to the consumer in simple terms what their data will be used for? 
Did I strive to make the explanation as concise as possible? 
This is important in order to preserve communication between the organization and the consumer.
3. Consistency and Trust: Do I protect my consumers' data the same way I would protect my own data? 
This is important because if data leaks, it could seriously damage others' lives.
4. Control and Transparency: Do I respect users' requests to hide or not store certain data points about them, even if they have recorded such information in the past? 
This is important because it gives the consumer a clear choice over which data is recorded and which is not recorded.
5. Consequences: Do I regularly review the consequences of the data I use to ensure that my methods lead to ethical results? This is important because methods may lead to unethical results that are only visible after the passage of time.
6. Are my methods peer reviewed by other professionals? This is important because peer review protects against inadvertent bad practices.
7. Are my methods implicitly targeting minority groups or other disadvantaged populations? Check to make sure this isn't the case! This is important in order to protect against self fulfilling feedback loops.
8. Do I regularly review my methods previously implemented? Do I ensure that they are consistent with current regulatory practices? This is important because regulations change over time and what was once legal may not always be legal.
